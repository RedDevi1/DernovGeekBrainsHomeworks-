Hello, Sergei.
I have 3 solutions for this exercise:
1. By the cycle "for" with 100 iterations
2. By the cycle "for" with 10 iterations with the enclosed cycle "for" with 10 iterations 
(array 10x10 for example) (but it has 100 iterations summary in fact)
3. This solution.

To my mind, this solution is the most effective in this case, because it has 7 iterations vs 100 in 
other solutions, but its not universal and it will work successfully only for increasing sequence of 
numbers 1 to 100.
